# Dashboard App

A simple Rust-based GUI application for Windows that serves as a dashboard to launch various tools and applications. The interface features clickable icons with corresponding labels, making it easy to access different functionalities directly from a single window.

## Key Features

- **Simple GUI Interface**: The app provides a clean and straightforward interface for launching multiple applications from a single dashboard.
- **Custom Icons**: Each tool/application has a custom icon, with labels positioned below the icons for easy identification.
- **Prevents Window Resizing**: The window size is fixed, preventing any resizing or maximization, ensuring consistent UI experience.
- **Custom Application Icon**: The app includes a custom icon displayed in the title bar and in the file explorer.
- **Hover and Click Effects**: Cursor changes to a hand icon on hover, and to a loading icon when an application is launched.

## Usage

This application is an essential tool for production managers, data analysts, and engineers who require quick access to various specialized tools and reports. The dashboard provides a centralized interface to launch multiple applications related to yield reporting, error tracking, quality control, and other critical processes. By offering a simple, icon-based navigation system, the app streamlines workflow, reduces the time spent searching for tools, and enhances overall productivity. Whether youâ€™re analyzing production data, planning workflows, or generating reports, this tool ensures that all necessary applications are just a click away, improving efficiency and focus on key tasks.

## Rust Branch and Complexity

- **Rust Version**: This project is built using stable Rust. Make sure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed.
- **Branch**: The default branch is `main`, which contains the latest stable code.
- **Complexity**: The codebase is simple and suitable for beginners to intermediates in Rust. It leverages the `eframe` crate for GUI, `egui` for UI elements, and standard Rust libraries for process management.

## Code Structure

- **`src/main.rs`**: The main entry point of the application, containing the core logic, GUI setup, and event handling.
- **`res/`**: Directory containing the icon file.
- **`Cargo.toml`**: The project configuration file, specifying dependencies and metadata.

### Core Components

- **DashboardApp Struct**: Holds the textures and manages the UI updates.
- **load_image Function**: Handles loading and resizing of PNG images for use as icons.
- **run_exe Function**: Launches the external applications when their respective buttons are clicked.

## Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Button Addition**: Implement a feature where users can dynamically add new buttons and applications to the dashboard without modifying the code.
- **Configuration File**: Use a configuration file (e.g., `JSON`, `TOML`) to define the applications and icons, allowing easy updates and modifications.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Extend the app's compatibility to other operating systems like macOS and Linux.
- **Themes and Customization**: Introduce customizable themes and layouts, allowing users to personalize the dashboard appearance.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Enhance error handling for launching applications and implement logging for better debugging.
